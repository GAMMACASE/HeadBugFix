# HeadBugFix
This plugin is a port from [momentum mod](https://momentum-mod.org/) that fixes the head boundary box poping up when you start ducking, this allows you to abuse it to reach the triggers that are above you and blocked by a thin ceiling, when it shouldn't be possible to reach otherwise.

This fix is a port of [this exact commit](https://github.com/momentum-mod/game/commit/dbcc8cc5f8dde2a4e049348dfbac761c8b8db7b7) in the momentum mod repository. So big thanks to that!

Currently there's a support for CSGO and CSS, and I'm not planning on supporting any other game.

## Requirements
* [Dhooks with detour support v15 or higher](https://forums.alliedmods.net/showpost.php?p=2588686&postcount=589);
* SourceMod 1.10 or higher.
